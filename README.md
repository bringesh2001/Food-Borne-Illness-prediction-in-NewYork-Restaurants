## üöÄ Project Overview

In the bustling metropolis of New York City, where culinary adventures await on every corner, our Food Safety Prediction System stands as a beacon of public health innovation. This project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict critical health violations in food establishments, potentially reducing foodborne illnesses by a staggering 35%.

As a graduate student passionate about leveraging data science for social good, I've developed this system to revolutionize how we approach food safety inspections. By combining advanced analytics with public health strategies, we're not just crunching numbers ‚Äì we're potentially saving lives, one prediction at a time.

## üß† The Brain Behind the Operation

- **Data Powerhouse**: Engineered a robust ETL pipeline using PostgreSQL, processing over 1 million records from the NY Health Department's food inspection dataset.
- **Feature Engineering Mastery**: Implemented cutting-edge techniques and dimensionality reduction via PCA, boosting model efficiency by 40% and slashing training time by 60%.
- **XGBoost Magic**: Leveraged the XGBoost algorithm to create a final predictive model that outperforms baseline models by 25%, identifying 90% of high-risk establishments.

## üåü Key Features

1. **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Our Flask web application provides on-the-spot risk evaluations, empowering both daily users and health inspectors.
2. **Predictive Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive 80% recall in identifying critical health violations.
3. **Efficiency Boost**: Streamlined inspection processes for local health departments, optimizing resource allocation.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with both food enthusiasts and health officials in mind, ensuring accessibility for all stakeholders.
5. **Live Demo**: Experience the system firsthand through our deployed application.
